Toxicity is one of the most important parameters that needs to be addressed in drug discovery and development. It is the main cause of failure in drug discovery and development.This web app was developed by training [Tox21 data](http://bioinf.jku.at/research/DeepTox/tox21.html) and it is expected to predict the toxcity of similar molecules with 77% accuracy.You can [click here](https://share.streamlit.io/gashawmg/tox21-web-app/main/Tox21.py) to do prediction.
